# Notes

Topic-based markdown notes (not daily logs).

Suggested structure:
- `howto/` — step-by-step guides you want to reuse
- `projects/` — per-project docs, decisions, setup

Conventions:
- Keep files small and focused.
- Put date-stamped raw events in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` instead.
- If something becomes a long-term personal preference, promote it to `MEMORY.md`.
