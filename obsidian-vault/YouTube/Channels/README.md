# YouTube Channels (clean structure)

This folder is intentionally **minimal**.

## Folder structure (only)

```
YouTube/
  Channels/
    <Channel Name>/
      Episodes/
        <Episode note>.md
```

That’s it. No extra folders.

## Rules (Allen’s requirements)

- Keep the directory **clean**. Do not create extra subfolders (no Inbox/Summaries/Templates/Indexes).
- Before creating any file, pause and ask: **do we really need this?**
- We only store episode notes under each channel’s `Episodes/` folder.

## Episode notes

Each episode note should record:
- Publish date/time (when available)
- What the episode says (summary based on transcript when possible)

If Allen asks for a YouTube summary:
- Prefer transcript/captions first.
- Summarize in English.
- Use transcript-only unless Allen asks otherwise.
