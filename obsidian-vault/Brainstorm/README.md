# Brainstorm (Allen + Lily)

Goal: find and ship a web/app product that people use and that generates income.

## Rules
- Keep notes small (one idea per note).
- Prefer links over folders; folders are just for light grouping.
- Use backlinks by linking concepts explicitly: `[[Problem - ...]]`, `[[Idea - ...]]`, `[[Experiment - ...]]`.

## Folder structure
- `Ideas/` — product ideas
- `Problems/` — user pains / jobs-to-be-done
- `Experiments/` — tests we run (landing page, SEO, cold outreach, etc.)
- `People/` — target personas / audiences

## Recommended note patterns
### Problem note
- Who has this problem?
- How painful / frequent?
- Current workaround?
- Why now?

### Idea note
- Which problem does it solve? (link to a Problem note)
- Who is the user? (link to a People note)
- What is the smallest version?
- How do we get users (distribution)?
- How does it make money?

### Experiment note
- Hypothesis
- Method
- Success metric
- Result
- Next step
