00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.150
Hello everyone, welcome to Wally Magazine. Today is...

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.130
February 28, 2026

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.210
The third piece of content is something everyone knows about the current US policy towards...

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.050
Iran launched an attack and Israel

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.430
Israel together with Iran this time

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.450
Lang's large-scale military action

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.950
The action means to completely overthrow

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.790
This regime, Trump is putting on a show.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.250
This episode will be about Guangdong.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.430
Trump's voiceover was provided by

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.710
I've been counting and counting for a long time.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.130
Why does he even believe that Iran...

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.770
This war has the potential to create

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.650
He also caused casualties among American troops.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.030
There are a lot of people who would do that.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.590
The charges against him were brought to light and then he was called...

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.910
The Lang people reclaimed their country and he

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.590
Some say this military operation

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.510
I will also consider the situation as follows.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.750
The original English film is placed

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.950
You can check the information below.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.810
His original English was...

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.330
The statement is always in Cantonese.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.810
We will try our best to achieve these voice-over results.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.350
It's fairly accurate, but there's still a chance.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.650
Let's not dwell on these discrepancies.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:27.770
Film We

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.230
The goal is to protect the United States

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.090
People eliminate the influence of Iranian politics

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.510
The urgent threat to power of this group

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.710
Humans are an extremely vicious group

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.350
Very malicious people's threats

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.630
This behavior directly harms our department in the United States

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.690
The team's overseas bases and we are still here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.130
Allies around the world for 47 years

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.710
The Iranian regime has been shouting

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.830
Down with the United States and endless campaigns

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.570
Bloodshed and massacre

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.310
Our troops also have actions targeting the United States.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
Innocent citizens in many, many countries

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.150
One of the earliest of these regimes

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.770
The action is to support violent seizure

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.270
Take the US Embassy in Texas

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.670
Lan and his group kidnapped dozens of people

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.690
American hostages for a full 444 days

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.410
Iran's proxy in 1983

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.610
People launched an attack in Beirut

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.890
Marine Corps barracks explode

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.930
The bombing killed 241 people.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.430
By 2000, American soldiers knew...

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.130
There is even a high chance of participating

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.890
With the attack on the US Cowell destroyer

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.410
Many of the destroyers did not survive the war.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.790
Lang forces in Iraq

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.210
The river merchant talked to hundreds of Americans

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.330
Military as a proxy of the regime

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.810
People have continued to target China in recent years

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.550
The US military in the East launched numerous

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.630
The attack also included US International Airlines.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.330
Naval and sea routes

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.770
Commercial ships are all affected by these

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.150
Large-scale terrorist acts we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.390
Lebanon will no longer tolerate this.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.810
So tender that Yemen from Syria

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.110
Until the regime in Iraq

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.470
Armed training and funding of terrorism

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.590
terrorist militias command the entire

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.930
The local bloodshed led to the uprising.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.970
October 7th against Israel

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.270
The brutal attack

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.050
They are Iran's proxies.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.530
Musk killed over 1000

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.770
Innocent people include 46 Americans

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.930
They also took 12 of our citizens hostage.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.970
The people being taken hostage is truly extreme

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.790
I've never seen such a cruel world before.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.210
Iran is the world leader in this matter.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.070
National-level terrorist support

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.250
The person also recently took to the streets to protest

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.510
He personally killed tens of thousands

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.710
The United States has always been particularly concerned about its own citizens.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.710
My government insists on one political system

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.230
The policy is this terrorist policy

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.170
Power must never be possessed.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.930
I'll say it again and again, they absolutely...

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.770
Therefore, it is forbidden to possess nuclear weapons.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.210
Five nights in June last year

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.730
In Operation Hammer, we thoroughly

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.990
The regime was completely destroyed.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.329
Fordonatanz and I

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.070
Sfahan's nuclear program

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.410
We warned after that attack

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.330
They should stop pursuing nuclear weapons.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.030
I also tried to reach an agreement with them many times.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.170
We did our best to reach an agreement.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.510
They want to do it, but they don't want to do it.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.670
They reiterated their desire to do this.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.090
They didn't want to do this because they didn't know what was happening.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.490
What did they do? They just wanted to do evil.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.270
But Iran refused, just like

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.810
They refused, just like they have for the past few decades.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.170
All nuclear ambitions were abandoned.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.710
We can no longer tolerate this opportunity.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.590
Instead of going down, they tried to go back.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.170
Nuclear construction plan and continued research and development

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.430
Research can pose a threat.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.730
Long-range missiles in Europe

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.150
Good friends and allies stationed abroad

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.890
The US military could even soon...

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.750
Imagine if it were to threaten the US mainland.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.030
This regime really possesses nuclear weapons.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.290
They were also used to deliver their messages.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.690
How arrogant they will be

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.770
The US military may be acting for these reasons.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.030
A large-scale operation has already begun.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.510
Model and continuous action

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.490
Prevent this extremely evil and extreme

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.450
A dictatorial regime threatens the United States

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.950
And our core national security

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.370
We will take away their profits.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.690
The missiles will be their missile workers

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.130
They will move the industry to the ground again

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.970
We will be completely wiped out next time.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.390
We will annihilate their navy

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.930
Ensure the terror in this region

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.990
The agent of ideology no longer has the ability

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.090
Force to undermine regional or global stability

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.250
They must not attack us again.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.450
They can no longer use the military.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.110
homemade bombs or roadside bombs

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.450
Sometimes this is called a serious bullet.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.150
Injury and killing of thousands

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.590
The tens of thousands of people, including many Americans, we

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.990
Ensure Iran cannot acquire nuclear weapons

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.490
Information is very simple, they always

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.210
This regime will not have nuclear weapons.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.010
You'll soon understand that no one should be challenged.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.190
The strength of the U.S. armed forces

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.450
And power, we have been in office for a long time

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.770
Our military was established and rebuilt

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.370
There is no army in the world.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.050
It can be compared with our military strength.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.330
Our government's power or procedures

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.950
We have done everything possible.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.830
To reduce the number of US troops stationed in this area

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.230
Even so, the people in the district and I

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.750
It is not rash to say that Iranian politics

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.070
Power is the courage to kill.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.550
American heroes might sacrifice us.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.510
There may be casualties in the war.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.570
These things happen from time to time, but

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.550
We did these things not for our present situation.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.690
It's for the future.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.870
A noble mission for us

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.890
Every soldier prays because

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.670
They selflessly risked their lives.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.030
Danger ensures Americans and our

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.830
The next generation will never be embraced

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.310
The threat of nuclear-armed Iran

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.010
We pray that God will protect all.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.450
Heroes in peril

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.170
I believe that with his help, the army

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.570
Men and women in the noodles will definitely

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.750
We are the strongest in the world to win.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.710
Their army will definitely win today.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.030
Tonight I will talk to the Islamic Revolution

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.790
Guards, armed forces and all

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.310
The police said you must put it down.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.970
This way, the weapon can be fully unleashed.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.290
Otherwise, one will have to face the inevitable

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.050
The inevitable end was death, so they let it go.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.730
You will gain by disarming yourselves.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.050
They deserve fair treatment and complete freedom.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.530
Otherwise, one will have to face the inevitable

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.970
In the end, I was certain of death.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.030
Tonight I will be with the great and self

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.690
The Iranian people say you are free.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.130
The moment has come to stay in safety

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.930
Do not leave your home.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.930
It's dangerous outside, there will be bombs.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.890
After we get everything sorted out...

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.630
You then take over your government.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.650
The government at that time belonged to this possibility.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.650
This is the only time in your generations.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.330
You've been looking for this opportunity for so many years

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.809
You asked the US for help, but you never did.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.409
None of them have ever received a total

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.490
I'm willing to do it tonight.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.350
What you're doing now is a total

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.370
The system truly gave you what you wanted.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.970
Let's see how you respond.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.390
The United States should now use overwhelming force

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.410
Power and destructive weaponry

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.950
Now is the time to give you the support you need.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.770
Your own destiny is about to be released

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.090
Prosperity and light within reach

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.890
Hui's future is now taking action.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.430
Don't let it roll away when it's moving.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.590
God bless the U.S. Armed Forces

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.530
The brave male and female officers and soldiers of the team

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.370
God bless America

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.050
United States of America, God bless!

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.870
Thank you for listening to Trump.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.730
After that, he will be here for so many years.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.130
Detailed reasoning over the past 47 years

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.030
The numbers were counted, and even funding was provided.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.690
Terrorism has become a

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.810
If a terrorist regime is

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.750
No wonder he said he didn't have it either.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.430
Underestimating Iran, even he

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.430
I think there's a chance that American soldiers will be injured.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.430
Even in death, one must do this.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.770
For 47 years, so many years have passed.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.550
The Iranian people are asking the United States for help, but

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.490
This time it's the only one I can't get.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.350
It's a one-time opportunity, so everyone has their own opinion.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.630
There are different opinions, but Iran

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.510
Did any of their allies help in this situation?

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.410
Are you busy? Do you dare or not?

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.210
If we don't help this time, will they come one by one?

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.430
Should we fall down or what? Perhaps everyone...

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.870
Let's have a lively discussion about this below.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.390
That's all for today, see you next time!

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.250
Everyone has heard this far, I hope everyone...
