- TTS: English Edge TTS works reliably; Cantonese TTS often errors. Default to English TTS for now.
- Preference: Allen may ask Lily to read responses aloud in English (TTS) because he doesn’t want to read text.

- Brain dump: Allen is a web developer (~3 years) with Next.js/Node.js/PHP/Drupal experience; wants to leverage AI (Claude Code + Lily) to build solo products (web/app) that generate income.
- Key lesson from prior project: strong technical execution isn’t enough; must answer "why users will use it" (problem validation/distribution).
- Request: create an Obsidian Brainstorm folder and use backlinks to connect notes and develop ideas.

- Brainstorm system expansion: add folders/notes for Signals, Models, and APIs (Brainstorm/Signals, Brainstorm/Models, Brainstorm/APIs) to support idea generation.
- Schedule request: daily 08:30 (Europe/London) "breathing session" message to Allen to review research/idea progress.
