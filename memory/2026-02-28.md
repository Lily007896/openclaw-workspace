- Preference: Allen wants Lily to always reply in **English** (even when source content is Chinese).

- Preference: Only commit/push to GitHub for backups via cron jobs. Do not commit/push unless Allen explicitly requests it.

- Workflow: For YouTube summaries, use transcript-first method (fetch captions/transcript via yt-dlp; summarize/translate based **only** on transcript unless Allen requests otherwise).
- Preference: Default to the **most efficient** method (no browser / headless when possible). Only open **Browser UI** when necessary, and **close it after use**.
